<h2>Labor market regulations</h2>
<p>The effects of labor market institutions on economic performance,
most importantly on unemployment, have been at the core of the economic
policy debates at least since the early 1970s. Although the labor market
constitutes the single largest market in any market economy, and the
functioning of labor market institutions has a significant impact on
economic growth and performance, there are not many empirical studies on
the effects of labor market institutions on economic growth and
productivity. For example, in his review article, Sala-I-Martin
(Sala-I-Martin, X.X. (1996), <i>I Just Ran Four Million Regressions</i>,
NBER Working Paper No. 6252, Cambridge, MA: NBER.1996) identified 62
variables that had been used in the empirical literature explaining
long-run growth across countries, but none of these variables referred
to labor market institutions.</p>
<p>Empirical studies on the effects of labor market institutions at the
macro-level suffer from the lack of data. There have been some attempts
by both researchers and international institutions to construct proxy
variables that reflect various aspects of labor markets institutions or
labor market flexibility. The World Bank’s Rigidity of Employment Index,
the OECD’s Employment Protection Legislation index, and the Labour
Market Institutions Database by Nickell and Nunziata are some of the
existing databases on labor market institutions. The main shortcoming of
these databases is the fact that they cover either a small group of
countries or short time periods so that they do not allow a panel data
analysis of developed and developing countries together. Rama and
Artecona prepared a panel database for a large number of countries.
Their database is based on the ratification of International Labour
Organisation (ILO) conventions on various subjects along with some other
measures like minimum wages, the number of trade union membership,
etc.</p>
<p>That is why we attempted to construct a new index as a proxy for the
degree of labor market regulation. The proposed index, derived from
<a href="http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/natlex_browse.home">ILO Natlex
Database</a>, is not a direct index but an approximation and based on
the number of laws and regulations on 100 different subjects adopted by
governments. It includes the annual data for 44 countries from 1960 to
2000.</p>
<p>In constructing the database, we first collected the number of laws
and regulations on different subjects related to labor markets from 1960
to 2000 for each country in the database. We included the laws
issued/adopted before 1960 in the year 1960. We summed the number of
laws on each subject over 5 year periods for 13 main subject categories
defined by the ILO. We, then, assumed that each law is effective for 15
years, and cumulated the (log) number of regulations for three periods
with the exception of the second period (1965-1969) that is composed of
the first two periods (1960-1964 and 1965-1969).</p>
<p>Since some of the subject categories were correlated with each other,
we carried out a factor analysis for two sub-periods, the pre- and
post-1980 periods, to reduce the dimensionality of the labor market
regulation subjects. On the basis of factor analysis, we grouped 13
subjects into four main categories defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>LMR 1: Employment conditions and wages</li>
<li>LMR 2: Work organization and social policy</li>
<li>LMR 3: Social and economic rights</li>
<li>LMR 4: Special provisions</li>
</ul>
<p>The first index, labeled as “Employment conditions and wages”,
includes regulations governing contracts of employment, wages and wage
payment system (minimum wage and protection of wages), personnel
management, termination of employment and dismissals, labor
administration and inspection, tripartite consultation, labor statistics
and training. This index is closely related to the issues discussed in
the literature on the effects of labor market institutions on economic
growth/productivity. This is our preferred index that is used in
empirical analysis.</p>
<p>The second index, “Work organization and social policy”, includes
regulations concerning work organization (working time, night work, rest
and leave, quality of working life) as well as issues on economic and
social policy including cooperatives, unemployment, employment services,
etc.</p>
<p>The third index, “Social and economic rights”, includes mostly
regulations on broad social and economic rights, including freedom of
association, non-discrimination, equal remuneration, industrial
relations (collective bargaining and agreements, workers participation,
labor disputes), occupational safety and health, social security
including unemployment benefit, and special provisions by category of
persons (children and young persons, women, indigenous and tribal
peoples, etc.). These provisions are likely to have non-discriminating
effect on all firms and sectors.</p>
<p>The final index basically covers laws and regulations specific to
certain activities/sectors. Most of the provisions in the database under
this category are about public servants.</p>
<p>Limitations, deficiencies, and measurement errors are inherited in
any database. Our index on labor market regulation also comes with its
own problems:</p>
<p>First, it is a very strong assumption that the number of labor market
regulations reflects the degree of regulation in the labor market,
because some laws and regulations may indeed deregulate the market. In
other words, the content of regulations could be more important than
their quantity. However, it is not practical to quantify the degree and
type of all regulations cited in the Natlex database. Second, we assumed
that a regulation remains in force for about 15 years. There is
certainly a great diversity concerning the time span of laws and
regulations. Moreover, some of the regulations may amend or replace
existing regulations so that a simple count of regulations adopted is
likely to generate an overestimation of the number of regulations in
force. Third, although we count all regulations equal, there are
substantial differences in the scope of laws and regulations. For
example, a single labor code in a country may regulate various aspects
of labor markets and industrial relations whereas in another country,
there could be many specific laws and regulations for the same issues.
Finally, the adoption of the law does not necessarily mean that it is
enforced.</p>
